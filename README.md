# awesome-crypto-examples

Wondering how to do "something you're trying to do" with some crypto _thing_?

Welcome to a loose collection of node.js examples and demos on various things crypto.

What kind of examples?
- Working with REST APIs
- Working with WebSockets
- anything else crypto + node.js?

Note: these are not a guide on best practices. These are purely demonstrations for one (or more) way(s) for doing various things.

## Getting started
All examples in this repo are in node.js and/or typescript.
- Ensure you have node.js installed (see `.nvmrc` for the recommended version (or later))
- Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Running a node.js example

Node.js examples will be any file that ends with `.js`. If the example has a readme, refer to the readme for specific instructions, otherwise use the following command to run the example with node.js:
```bash
node src/path/to/example.js
```

### Running a typescript example

Typescript examples will be any file that ends with `.ts`. If the example has a readme, refer to the readme for specific instructions, otherwise use the following command to run the example with typescript's ts-node:
```bash
npx ts-node src/path/to/example.js
```

Refer to the following documentation for guidance on ts-node: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node#installation

## Contributing

PRs for various concepts welcome. Typescript preferred, but plain javascript is also OK.

Not sure what to add? What would've helped you when you were first getting started?

How big can a demonstration be? If it's useful & reasonable for others to learn from, as big as you want!
